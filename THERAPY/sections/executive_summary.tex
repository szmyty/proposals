\section*{Executive Summary}

Mental health challenges are rising across the globe, with suicide rates, substance abuse, and emotional dysregulation impacting millions\autocite{who_suicide_2025, who_substance_2022} — yet most therapeutic support remains episodic, underfunded, and disconnected from daily lived experience.

\textbf{THERAPY} — *Therapeutic, Holistic, Emotional Resilience and AI-driven Personalized You* — is a proposed digital decision support ecosystem that bridges the gap between therapy sessions. It integrates mood tracking, AI-assisted journaling, secure therapist dashboards, and ethically designed data summarization to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Strengthen the therapeutic alliance and improve continuity of care
  \item Provide therapists with weekly AI-generated emotional trend summaries
  \item Equip clients with tools for reflection and self-discovery
  \item Enable earlier identification of high-risk emotional patterns
\end{itemize}

THERAPY is not a replacement for human connection — it is an augmentation of it. It empowers clinicians to do what they do best, with support from contextual, compassionate, and privacy-respecting AI insights.

\noindent\textit{
Just as therapy enables self-discovery, self-discovery enables us to reverse-engineer our unhealthy thought patterns — and replace them with intentional, healthier strategies.
}

\bigskip

THERAPY is envisioned as an open-source, modular, and extensible platform that can be piloted in clinical, nonprofit, or academic settings — particularly among populations impacted by trauma, addiction, or systemic barriers to care.

This proposal outlines the purpose, structure, research foundation, and funding opportunities for bringing the THERAPY system to life.
