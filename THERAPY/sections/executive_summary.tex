\section*{Executive Summary}

Mental health challenges are rising across the globe, with suicide rates, substance abuse, and emotional dysregulation impacting millions — yet most therapeutic support remains episodic, underfunded, and disconnected from daily lived experience.

\textbf{THERAPY} (Therapeutic, Holistic, Emotional Resilience and AI-driven Personalized You) is a proposed digital decision support ecosystem that strengthens the connection between therapists and clients between sessions. It combines client mood tracking, AI-assisted journaling, secure therapist dashboards, and ethically designed data summaries to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Enhance therapeutic alliance and continuity of care
  \item Enable therapists to review AI-generated emotional trend summaries
  \item Empower clients with tools for self-discovery and reflection
  \item Identify and intervene in high-risk patterns earlier
\end{itemize}

This system is not a replacement for therapy — it is an augmentation of it. It allows human clinicians to do what they do best, with the contextual support of AI-driven insights grounded in compassion, privacy, and client empowerment.

\bigskip
\noindent\textit{
Just as therapy enables self-discovery, self-discovery enables us to reverse-engineer our unhealthy thought patterns and practice healthier strategies with awareness and intention.
}

\bigskip
THERAPY is envisioned as an open-source, modular, and extensible platform that can be piloted in clinical, nonprofit, or academic settings — especially in populations affected by trauma, substance abuse, and underserved access to care.

\bigskip
This proposal outlines the purpose, structure, research foundation, and funding opportunities for bringing the THERAPY system to life.
