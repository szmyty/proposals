\textit{
“Therapy is not just a space for support — it is a mechanism for self-discovery. \\
Through self-discovery, individuals gain the ability to reverse-engineer their own unhealthy thought patterns. \\
This awareness becomes the blueprint for replacing those patterns with deliberate, constructive practices and strategies.”
