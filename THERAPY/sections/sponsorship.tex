\section*{Sponsorship and Institutional Alignment}

The \textbf{THERAPY} system is aligned with current U.S. federal and nonprofit initiatives that support digital mental health tools, suicide prevention, and substance abuse intervention. It is designed to advance national goals in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modernizing mental health infrastructure
  \item Enhancing suicide prevention and crisis response
  \item Deploying AI-driven therapeutic decision support
  \item Expanding equitable access for underserved populations
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Potential Sponsorship Channels}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Sponsorship Objectives}

Strategic sponsorship and institutional collaboration would enable:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Full-stack development of the THERAPY mobile app, therapist dashboard, and backend insight engine
  \item Rigorous pilot deployment and outcome validation through academic and clinical partners
  \item Co-design with clinicians, ethicists, and representatives of vulnerable populations

These opportunities offer a clear path toward scaling compassionate, evidence-based, and ethically guided mental health support systems nationwide.
