\section*{Development Roadmap}

The development of the \textbf{THERAPY} system is envisioned as an iterative, collaborative process that prioritizes ethical design, pilot feedback, and real-world clinical integration. Below is an approximate roadmap based on current assumptions. Timelines are subject to refinement as partnerships and resourcing evolve.

\subsection*{Phase 1: Prototype (Months 0–3)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build core journaling, mood tracking, and AI summarization pipeline
  \item Design early therapist dashboard with mock data
  \item Consult with clinical advisors on data ethics and risk signals
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 2: Pilot \& Evaluation (Months 4–8)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Deploy app with 3–5 therapist-client pairs
  \item Integrate opt-in consent flows and privacy guardrails
  \item Collect usage data and feedback on therapist usability
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 3: Expansion (Months 9–15)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend backend for analytics and research use
  \item Explore integrations with open EHR formats
  \item Prepare academic paper or policy brief on pilot results
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Phase 4: Open Release (Months 16+)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Package system for public use with full documentation
  \item Open-source modules for adaptation in clinics, nonprofits, and academia
  \item Continue research and community-led development
\end{itemize}
