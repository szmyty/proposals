"Can buprenorphine reduce suicide mortality?","Buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) in Veterans Affairs patients showed a lower suicide mortality rate compared to methadone treatment.","L. Sher",2022,1,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent worldwide and a significant medical and social problem around the world.1–4 According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, globally, about 275 million individuals (or 5.5% of the global population aged 15–64 years) used drugs at least once in 2019. Among them, about 62 million people used opioids. Worldwide, about 36.3 million people had substance use disorders in 2019. SUDs are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally.1–4 SUDs are associated with various medical illnesses including infectious diseases, chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders. SUDs are frequently comorbid with other psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Regretfully, most individuals with SUDs never receive treatment for SUDs. SUDs are a significant risk factor for suicidal behavior. Individuals with SUDs have a 10–14 times larger risk of death by suicide compared with the general population. One investigation found that opioids were present in 20% of suicide deaths, marijuana in 10.2%, cocaine in 4.6%, and amphetamines in 3.4%. Many drug overdoses may be unrecognized suicides. Drug-overdose deaths are often categorized as “undetermined” if there is no known history of depressive disorder or a suicide note. The United States has seen a significant increase in drug overdose deaths and suicides in the past two decades. Drug overdose deaths exceeded an annual rate of 100,000 for the first time in 2021. According to the National Center for Health Statistics of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, there were 107,622 drug overdose deaths in the United States during 2021, an increase of nearly 15% from the 93,655 deaths in 2020. Over 75% of overdoses were related to the use of opioids, frequently fentanyl. The rate of drug poisoning deaths continues to increase in other countries. For example, the rate of drug poisoning deaths in England and Wales was 81.1% higher in 2021 than it was in 2012. Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) are an effective treatment for patients with OUD and, frequently, need to be combined with psychotherapy. Three current medications for the management of OUD approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration include methadone (an opioid agonist), buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). An important and timely study comparing mortality rates for buprenorphine and methadone treatments among a large sample of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with OUD residing in the 50 United States and Washington, DC, is published in this issue of the journal. The authors obtained data from VA databases as well as linked Medicaid claims for VA patients who received methadone and buprenorphine from 2010 through 2019 and measured all-cause mortality, overdose mortality, and suicide mortality among these patients. The authors found that buprenorphine is associated with an approximately 20% reduction in risk adjusted all-cause mortality and 40% reduction in suicides compared with methadone. No differences were observed in overdose mortality. The authors proposed that the benefit of buprenorphine over methadone in the United States is mediated by greater patient retention in treatment. The authors also observed that there were substantial and sustained regional differences in prescribing buprenorphine versus methadone. This may indicate that generally recognized and accepted guidelines for prescribing buprenorphine and methadone are needed. Earlier, the same research group examined suicide mortality, external causes of mortality, and all-cause mortality in a large sample in the 5 years following initiation of buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. When comparing effects of these medications on mortality risk, only buprenorphine had a significant effect on reducing suicide mortality and external causes of mortality in models adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and health care utilization. Buprenorphine was associated with a decrease of suicide risk of more than 65%. Other studies also suggest that the use of buprenorphine reduces suicidal and self-injurious behavior. For example, another retrospective cohort study of U.S. Veterans receiving buprenorphine in 2008–2017 across any VA facility showed that Veterans who were not receiving buprenorphine were 4.3 times more likely to die by suicide/overdose than those receiving buprenorphine on any given day. Also, the risk of suicide/overdose was highest 8–14 days from buprenorphine discontinuation in comparison to currently receiving buprenorphine pharmacotherapy.

Gomes",2024,0,"Introduction In recent years, there has been an increase in the prevalence of illicit use of fentanyl and other opioids in the United States population. This has led to an increase in medical, psychopathological and abuse-associated comorbidity, an increase in deaths and a decrease in the age of consumption, and has become a serious emerging problem in young people. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman from the United States who recently settled in Spain and started a follow-up in Mental Health due to opioid and other substance abuse problems. Objectives To address the growing problem surrounding the illicit use of fentanyl and opioids as drugs of abuse based on the presentation of the clinical case mentioned above. Methods Bibliographic search and description of a clinical case of a patient under follow-up by Mental Health at the “Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valladolid”. Results An 18-year-old woman from the United States who has been living with her father in Spain since the summer of 2023, having moved to Spain due to problems related to substance abuse. With no previous medical or surgical history and with a history of follow-up in Mental Health in her country of origin for depressive symptomatology, dysfunctional personality traits and abuse of different toxic substances since adolescence. After a brief and erratic follow-up in Psychiatry for anxious-depressive symptoms reactive to a complex and conflictive relationship with his mother and marked academic difficulties during the first years of adolescence, at the age of 15 he started using cannabis and alcohol, thus beginning a period marked by relationships with marginalized sectors of the population, substance abuse and school failure. As his cannabis consumption intensified, he began to consume fentanyl prescribed to his mother, as well as other opioids to which he had access illegally, for which reason he had to be admitted twice to detoxification centers without results, which is why his family finally decided to move him to Spain. Conclusions In recent years, fentanyl abuse has become a serious public health problem that is mainly centered in the young population. High levels of impulsivity and lack of frustration tolerance predispose to the use of illicit substances for elusive purposes. Substance abuse carries with it not only an important organic comorbidity, but also a marked socio-familial and economic repercussion.

"Exploring the Psychological Side of Fentanyl: A Scoping Review to Disclose the Psychosocial Dimensions of Illicitly Manufactured Fentanyl Users.","Illicitly Manufactured Fentanyl users are younger, have low risk perception, and are significantly associated with mental disorders like suicidal thoughts, anxiety disorders, and depression.","Pasquale Caponnetto, Sergio Triscari, Graziella Chiara Prezzavento, Giorgia Farrugio, Chiara Farrauto, Simona Lanzafame, Giulia Schilirò, Eleonora Uccelli, Noemi Maria Vitale, Abdulnaser Fakhrou, Karim Nagi, C. Concerto",2024,0,"Background
Fentanyl is a powerful opioid. The abuse and overdoses related to Illicitly Manufactured Fentanyl (IMF) have become more prevalent. The majority of clinical studies on fentanyl have focused on its medical and biological aspects, particularly its addictive properties. Few studies have delved into the psychological aspects of illicit fentanyl use, and there is currently no comprehensive review providing a structured psycho-social profile of the population groups most vulnerable to its effects. The goal of this Scoping Review was to construct a psychological and social profile of individuals at risk of using illicit fentanyl. This profile will serve as a guiding force for shaping behavioral policies and public health prevention efforts necessary to face the recent pandemic.


Methods
Following the PRISMA guidelines we conducted a Scoping Review focused on the following research question: What are the practical psycho-social implications of illicit fentanyl use in the global population?


Results
The bibliographic research was carried out in the databases of Medline, Scopus, and PsycNet. The articles resulting from the research phase in the databases listed above produced a total of 17737 reports. After the screening process, 10 studies were included in the scoping review.


Discussion and Conclusion
This scoping review was the first to consistently and systematically outline the psychosocial implications of fentanyl dependence. Users of IMF are consistently younger than other drug users. People using fentanyl have a relatively low perception of risk. On the psycho-social levels, there is a significant correlation between fentanyl use and mental disorders such as suicidal thoughts, anxiety disorders, and depression. The development of psychotherapy, along with digital tools such as apps and online platforms, can be an initial step in addressing this challenge.","systematic review","Health psychology research","2","10.52965/001c.120958","https://consensus.app/papers/exploring-the-psychological-side-of-fentanyl-a-scoping-caponnetto-triscari/90b43cededd7502dba3729f0bbc62a9c/"

"The Fentanyl Epidemic and Evolution of Fentanyl Analogs in the United States and the European Union.","Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs have become a global public health threat, with a surge in overdose deaths caused by heroin laced with illicit substances.","P. Jannetto, A. Helander, U. Garg, G. Janis, B. Goldberger, Hemamalini Ketha",2019,131,"BACKGROUND
Since 2013, an unprecedented surge in fentanyl overdose deaths has been caused by heroin laced with illicitly produced fentanyl and/or fentanyl analogs (FAs) sold as heroin. The US Drug Enforcement Agency's National Forensic Laboratory Information System reported a >300% increase in fentanyl encounters from 4697 in 2014 to 14440 in 2015. In 2015, the CDC reported 9580 deaths caused by synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, a 72% increase from 2014. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has also encountered several new FAs in the heroin supply. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals containing mixtures of fentanyl and FAs continue to be a poorly recognized worldwide problem despite the WHO classifying several FAs as a serious threat to public health.


CONTENT
This review covers the epidemiology of fentanyl abuse and discusses the clinical practice implications of widespread fentanyl abuse. It includes a historical perspective on the illicit FAs that have appeared in the US and European Union and reviews the methods available to identify FAs and emerging technologies useful for identifying previously undescribed analogs. A compilation of structural and mass spectral data on FAs reported thus far is provided.


SUMMARY
Fentanyl and FAs have evolved into a global public health threat. It is important to understand the analytical, clinical, and regulatory efforts underway to assist communities affected by the current fentanyl epidemic.","literature review","Clinical chemistry","1","10.1373/clinchem.2017.281626","https://consensus.app/papers/the-fentanyl-epidemic-and-evolution-of-fentanyl-analogs-in-jannetto-helander/1592c2fe41d65123b77c55b7b567561c/"

"Overdose Deaths Involving Fentanyl and Fentanyl Analogs — New York City, 2000–2017","Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs have significantly increased the risk of fatal drug overdoses in New York City, leading to a 55% increase in fatal overdoses from 2015 to 2017, with early identification aiding in risk reduction messaging.","Cody Colon-Berezin, Michelle L. Nolan, Jaclyn Blachman-Forshay, D. Paone",2019,65,"Unintentional drug overdose deaths have climbed to record high levels, claiming approximately 70,000 lives in the United States in 2017 alone (1). The emergence of illicitly manufactured fentanyl* (a synthetic, short-acting opioid with 50-100 times the potency of morphine) mixed into heroin, cocaine, and counterfeit pills, with or without the users' knowledge, has increased the risk for fatal overdose (2,3). The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) conducts routine overdose mortality surveillance by linking death certificates with toxicology findings from the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). A 55% increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose in NYC was observed from 2015 to 2017, resulting in the highest number of overdose deaths recorded since systematic reporting began in 2000. Toxicology data indicate that this unprecedented increase in overdose deaths is attributable to fentanyl. Early identification of increased fentanyl involvement enabled DOHMH to respond rapidly to the opioid overdose epidemic by increasing awareness of the risks associated with fentanyl and developing effective risk reduction messaging. These results strongly suggest that, wherever possible, jurisdictions should consider integrating toxicology findings into routine overdose surveillance and work with local medical examiners or coroners to include fentanyl in the literal text on death certificates.","","Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report","1","10.15585/mmwr.mm6802a3","https://consensus.app/papers/overdose-deaths-involving-fentanyl-and-fentanyl-analogs-%E2%80%94-colon-berezin-nolan/0abe866c80c652dbae2a27119e462eef/"

"Youth fatal drug overdose and suicide: Trends in Connecticut, 2019-2021.","Youth fatal drug overdose rates in Connecticut increased significantly from 2016 to 2021, driven by fentanyl and polysubstance use, with intentional overdose rates doubled from 3.8% to 7.7%.","Y. Kaminer, Rebecca H. Burke, Simon Zhornitsky, James Gill, Kristyn Zajac, V. Hesselbrock",2023,1,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Increasing rates of fatal drug overdose (FDO) among youth since 2016 have been driven by fentanyl and polysubstance use. Suicide by youth also increased steadily since 2007. The manner of FDO may be accidental (i.e., unintentional) or suicidal (i.e., intentional). This report examines the rate of youth intentional and unintentional FDO as well as specific drug toxicology in Connecticut, between the years 2019 and 2021, compared to a 2016-2018 report.


METHODS
We reviewed N = 286 consecutive FDO files of youth, <26 years of age dated for 2019-2021 from the Connecticut Medical Examiner's office.


RESULTS
FDO attributed to fentanyl increased significantly from 2016 to 2018 to 2019 to 2021. Xylazine FDO emerged in 2019 and reached 16% in 2021. Intentional FDO rates doubled between these periods from 3.8% to 7.7%. Most FDOs involved individuals aged 20-25 years, whereas 10% were among those aged 15-19. For the first time since 2018, FDO among 10-14 years old was detected. Analysis of gender found no differences. Within each gender, however, FDO attributed to fentanyl increased significantly between these periods. The FDO rate for Hispanics increased significantly, while the rate for Whites decreased significantly.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The availability of high lethality potential drugs leading to youth FDO including an increasing rate of intentional FDO, is a public health concern. It is prudent to identify modifiable acute high-risk circumstances for intentional FDO and prevention-intervention evidence-based approach to reduce FDO.
