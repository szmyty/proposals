## 🧠 Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the vision for **THERAPY**, a system designed to augment human mental health care through the integration of **AI-driven summarization**, **biometric context**, and **continuous insight loops** between clients and their therapists. The aim is not to replace therapeutic relationships, but to enhance them—offering clinicians a high-level overview of their client’s emotional and physiological state between sessions.

The project arises from a growing need: suicide rates, substance use (particularly fentanyl-related overdoses), and depression are all rising in parallel. At the same time, therapy remains episodic, often blind to the nuance of what happens between appointments. THERAPY seeks to fill that gap—ethically, collaboratively, and with personalization at its core.

Through data-driven insights, responsible AI, and a feedback-rich interface, this system empowers:
- **Clients** to reflect, learn, and self-regulate.
- **Therapists** to gain deeper awareness and prepare more effectively.
- **Communities** to understand the broader context of suffering and healing.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Despite growing awareness of mental health, current systems of care remain **episodic**, **reactive**, and **out-of-context**, relying heavily on retrospective self-reporting that can obscure the real emotional landscape between appointments.

Three interconnected public health crises highlight this gap:

1. **Rising Suicide Rates**  
   - The U.S. age-adjusted suicide rate climbed 30% from 2002 (10.9 per 100,000) to 2018 (14.2), with a rebound to 14.2 in 2022 after a slight dip during the COVID-19 pandemic

     [JAMA Study (2024)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2812585)
   - In 2023, over 49,300 people died by suicide, maintaining the nation's highest yearly total since 1941

2. **Surging Opioid & Fentanyl Overdoses**  
   - Drug overdose deaths involving opioids rose from 49,860 in 2019 to 81,806 in 2022; synthetic opioids (mainly fentanyl) accounted for over 70,000 deaths in 2022  
     [CDC Provisional Data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm)
   - In New York, opioid-related death rates increased fivefold from 5 per 100,000 in 2010 to 25 per 100,000 in 2021

3. **Mental Health Disorders & Substance Use**  
   - A systematic review found that 37 of 38 studies reported significant associations between mental disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) and opioid overdose

   - In 2017, over 40% of combined suicide and overdose deaths involved opioids

> **There is a critical gap between what happens *inside* the therapy room and what happens *between* sessions.**

---

These trends emphasize how suicide, substance abuse, and mental health conditions—rather than occurring independently—are deeply intertwined, especially in the context of opioid use and emotional distress. Yet current therapeutic models rarely capture the **continuity and context** required to understand these overlapping crises.

The **THERAPY** system responds to this need by embedding continuous, ethically collected client data into an intelligent AI-backed loop—empowering therapists with richer insights, helping clients gain self-awareness, and enabling a more responsive approach to mental health care.
