# Informal Proposal: Augmented Decision Support for Mental Health Practitioners

**Author:** Alan Szmyt  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Audience:** Group leads, colleagues interested in decision support tooling and AI-assisted mental health tools  

---

## Summary

This proposal outlines a concept for a human-AI teaming system designed to assist therapists and psychiatrists by providing richer, continuous insights into their clients' mental health states. The concept leverages conversational AI, biometric data, and robust analytics to address significant gaps in traditional episodic therapy.

---

## Core Problem

Mental health professionals typically rely on periodic, isolated interactions with clients. This approach lacks continuous visibility into clients' emotional fluctuations, contextual stressors, and real-time mental health shifts occurring outside therapy sessions.

---

## Proposed Solution

A clinician-facing dashboard integrated with:
- **Conversational AI** for daily interactions and emotional insights.
- **Biometric signals** from wearables (heart rate, sleep quality).
- **Routine client check-ins** (daily mood/anxiety ratings).

These tools provide therapists summarized, actionable, and continuous insights.

---

## Key Features

- **Conversation Summarization:** AI-driven summaries highlighting emotional trends from chatbot interactions.
- **Mood Tracking and Analysis:** Continuous visual tracking of mood and anxiety ratings.
- **Biometric Data Correlation:** Integration of physiological data with mental health indicators.
- **Theme Classification:** Automatic tagging of prevalent psychological themes (e.g., anxiety, stress).
- **Therapist Dashboard:** Intuitive interface highlighting critical insights and correlations.

---

## Guiding Design Principles

- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Enhance therapist decision-making without replacing clinical judgment.
- **Privacy and Ethics:** Transparent data handling, strict anonymization, and explicit client consent.
- **Client Empowerment:** Client-controlled data sharing and usage transparency.
- **Low Friction, High Value:** Minimal additional workload; maximal informational benefit.

## Holistic Healing & Societal Impact

This initiative supports broader holistic mental health frameworks by:
- Empowering personal growth through self-reflection and data-driven insights.
- Strengthening the therapeutic alliance via shared, continuous insights.
- Enhancing community mental health by proactive, informed interventions.

Key research underscores mental health urgency:

## Next Steps & Research Needs

- **Domain Expert Interviews:** Validate assumptions through discussions with practicing therapists and psychologists.
- **Ethical Framework Development:** Define clear ethical and privacy guidelines.
- **Prototype Development:** Initial visualizations and proof-of-concept dashboard development.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Identify credible datasets to support visual insights and credibility.

  **Summary:** The study conducted by researchers at Dartmouth found that a generative AI-powered therapy chatbot called Therabot resulted in significant improvements in participants' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. After eight weeks of using Therabot, participants experienced a marked reduction in symptoms that exceeded what clinicians consider statistically significant. Participants also reported a degree of "therapeutic alliance" with Therabot comparable to working with a mental health professional. The study suggests that generative AI has the potential to increase patient engagement and provide real-time support for people who lack regular or immediate access to a mental health professional. However, the researchers emphasize the need for rigorous oversight and involvement of mental health experts in the development and clinical testing of these systems to ensure safety and efficacy.
