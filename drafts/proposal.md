# Informal Proposal: Augmented Decision Support for Mental Health Practitioners

**Author:** Alan Szmyt  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Audience:** Group leads, colleagues interested in decision support tooling and AI-assisted mental health tools  

---

## Summary

This proposal outlines a concept for a human-AI teaming system designed to assist therapists and psychiatrists by providing richer, continuous insights into their clients' mental health states. The concept leverages conversational AI, biometric data, and robust analytics to address significant gaps in traditional episodic therapy.

---

## Core Problem

Mental health professionals typically rely on periodic, isolated interactions with clients. This approach lacks continuous visibility into clients' emotional fluctuations, contextual stressors, and real-time mental health shifts occurring outside therapy sessions.

---

## Proposed Solution

A clinician-facing dashboard integrated with:
- **Conversational AI** for daily interactions and emotional insights.
- **Biometric signals** from wearables (heart rate, sleep quality).
- **Routine client check-ins** (daily mood/anxiety ratings).

These tools provide therapists summarized, actionable, and continuous insights.

---

## Key Features

- **Conversation Summarization:** AI-driven summaries highlighting emotional trends from chatbot interactions.
- **Mood Tracking and Analysis:** Continuous visual tracking of mood and anxiety ratings.
- **Biometric Data Correlation:** Integration of physiological data with mental health indicators.
- **Theme Classification:** Automatic tagging of prevalent psychological themes (e.g., anxiety, stress).
- **Therapist Dashboard:** Intuitive interface highlighting critical insights and correlations.

---

## Guiding Design Principles

- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Enhance therapist decision-making without replacing clinical judgment.
- **Privacy and Ethics:** Transparent data handling, strict anonymization, and explicit client consent.
- **Client Empowerment:** Client-controlled data sharing and usage transparency.
- **Low Friction, High Value:** Minimal additional workload; maximal informational benefit.

## Holistic Healing & Societal Impact

This initiative supports broader holistic mental health frameworks by:
- Empowering personal growth through self-reflection and data-driven insights.
- Strengthening the therapeutic alliance via shared, continuous insights.
- Enhancing community mental health by proactive, informed interventions.
